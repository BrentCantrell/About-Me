  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a Frontend Web Development         Student. A proud American Expatriate currently living in Dubai. I would describe myself as an optimistic dreamer who loves to create. </p>
  <p>Fridays are my favorite. My wife, daughter, and I always go to the same coffee shop for breakfast. Then it's a trip to the arcade to play with my daughter. Followed by ice cream and a leisurely walk around our neighbourhood mall. We then return home for a afternoon nap.</p>
  <p>I am so excited about the opportunity to learn web development. I think it is great that I can use the web to learn about the web. I see nothing but opportunity at this point in my life and I love it. I want to be able to think of cool stuff and go build it. </p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I am from the middle of nowhere. Don’t believe me, just type Mouth Card, Kentucky into Google Maps and you’ll see. Born and raised in Eastern Kentucky, my family and I relocated to Richmond Kentucky when I was sixteen. It was a great move for me and my family.
